Dynamic Blog, form validation, update and delete using PHP Laravel

This project was built using PHP Laravel and Bootstrap. Though, it looks rough on the edges, as I'm a newbie to the use of laravel frameworks, Also learning
how to use it for various purposes like 'form valdation, dynamism, delete, update and to fetch posts from the database'. It's been a lovely experience
thus far, and I look forward to learning more about PHP laravel and it's usefulness.
